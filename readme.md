   ```
   python DPS_balancer.py
   ```

## 🛠️ Usage
1️⃣ The script will clear the terminal screen and display the first page of results.
2️⃣ Each page shows a set of gun stat variations, including damage, fire rate, and DPS.
3️⃣ Use the following commands to navigate through the pages:
 - [N] Next: Go to the next page.
 - [P] Previous: Go to the previous page.
 - [Q] Quit: Exit the script.

## 📋 Example Output

1️⃣ **Damage (int or float):** The amount of damage the gun deals per shot.
2️⃣ **Fire rate (int or float):** The number of shots the gun fires per minute.
3️⃣ **Damage variation range (float):** The range within which the damage values will vary.
4️⃣ **Fire rate variation range (float):** The range within which the fire rate values will vary.
5️⃣ **Fire rate step (float):** The step value for fire rate variations.
6️⃣ **DPS range (float):** The range within which the calculated DPS values should fall.

**Example Input Data**

## 📊 Results
The script generates variations of gun stats and displays them in a paginated format. Here is an example of the results generated by the script:

```python
results = [
    (46.0, 640.0),  # 46 damage per shot, 640 shots per minute
    # Add more variations as needed
]
```
